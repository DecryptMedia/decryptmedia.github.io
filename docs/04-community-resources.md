### Decrypt Docs (this website)

This documentation site is managed by a [public repo on GitHub](https://github.com/DecryptMedia/decryptmedia.github.io/). Community members can create proposals to edit these documents with what's called a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

The Decrypt team will review, comment, and when approved, merge and deploy pull request changes to this website.
